## Scrape spotlight.it-notes.ru images

Most Windows 10 machines have 'Spotlight' on their lock screen, it fetches a nice new lock screen image almost every day.

I found a site that hosts all the previous images (1600+ I think), but I didn't like how it only shows 5 images per page. So I decided to build a quick app to scrape the latest 100 images in one hit (I might implement some pagination soon). Once you scrape, click the pic to find out more info. Some of the images are amazing. Enjoy...
